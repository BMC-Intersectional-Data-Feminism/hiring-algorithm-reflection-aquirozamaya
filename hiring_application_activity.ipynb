    "Activity adapted from exercise developed by [Evan Peck](https://evanpeck.github.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario: Moogle’s Hiring Filter\n",
    "Imagine you are working for Moogle, a well-known tech company that receives tens of thousands of job applications from graduating seniors every year. Since the company receives too many job applications for HR to individually assess in a reasonable amount of time, you are asked to create a program that algorithmically analyzes applications and selects the ones most worth passing onto HR.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applicant Data\n",
    "It’s difficult to create these first-pass cuts, so Moogle designs their application forms to get some numerical data about their applicants’ education. Job applicants must enter the grades they received in 6 core CS courses, as well as their overall GPA. For your convenience, this will be stored in a python `list` that you can access. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a student who received the following scores. . .\n",
    "- Intro to CS: 100\n",
    "- Data Structures: 95\n",
    "- Software Engineering: 80\n",
    "- Algorithms: 89\n",
    "- Computer Organization: 91\n",
    "- Operative Systems: 75\n",
    "- Overall GPA: 83\n",
    "\n",
    ". . . would result in the following list: `[100, 95, 80, 89, 91, 75, 83]`. You can assume that index `0` is always Intro to CS, `1` is always Data Structures, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you are processing many applications, your program will receive a list of lists. For example, this would be the information for 3 applicants:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[ [100, 95, 80, 89, 91, 75, 83], [75, 80, 85, 90, 85, 88, 90], [85, 70, 99, 100, 81, 82, 91] ]`"

For this exercise we will be focusing on how to access items within a list and iterate over a list so that you can access each item individually. Let's practice that again here. "

    "3. What systemic advantages/disadvantages are your algorithms likely to amplify?\n",
    "\n",
    "The systematic disadvantages my algorithm is likely to amplify is the fact that it choosen an applicant based off of one grade and that may not be reflected on the other grades, it might've been their lowest or highest grade. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If you had access to additional data beyond grades (e.g., extracurricular activities, internships, letters of recommendation), how might you incorporate it into your selection process? Would it make your algorithm fairer or introduce new biases?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to see the number of letters of recommendations and look at the positive characters within those letters to get a better understanding of how that student is described. I think it may introduce new biases however given that some students may not have been able to take advantage of the same opportunities or in as many opportunities as other students due to family responsibilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How do current hiring filter algorithms work? What problems do they encounter? How do these algorithms broadly compare to the ones we wrote today? (Some example articles discussing hiring filters linked below in citations but you're not limited to these examples) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example of the Amazon recruiting tool, there was a bias against women given that more male applicants were in the pool and the algorithm trained itself to believe that male applicants were superior to female applicants. This is a huge problem because the algorithm learns through patterns and these patterns reflect discrimination in workplaces which he hiring process is an important step in working against this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What does it mean to design a fair algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing a fair algorithm involves taking into account every aspect of natural patterns in the world that are placed as a cause of underresourced communities or simply a lack of a certain group of people in specific fields that may train the algorithm to think of one group better fit for one job than another taking into account these patterns more than other factors. Fair algorithms should understand the various factors and challenges that people face which is case-by-case dependent. \n"
